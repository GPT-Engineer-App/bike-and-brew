# bike-and-brew

Create a website for a trendy coffee place that caters to bikers, blending the adventurous spirit of biking with the comfort and warmth of a coffee shop. The design should be modern and user-friendly, leveraging the Chakra UI component library for its flexibility and efficiency.

Color Scheme and Typography
Primary Colors: Dark gray (#333) and leather brown (#845422) to evoke the feel of bike gear and coffee richness. Accents in vintage red (#D04E50) to add energy and contrast.
Secondary Colors: Cream (#F3ECE0) for background areas to soften the overall look and provide a warm, inviting feel.
Typography: Use a combination of a rugged, bold typeface for headings to mirror the biking culture and a warm, inviting serif for body text to convey the coffee shop's coziness.
Imagery and Graphics
High-quality images featuring close-ups of coffee in various forms (beans, brewing, and in cups) and biking themes (parts of bikes, riders gathering at the cafe, scenic routes).
Use illustrations and icons that merge coffee elements with biking, such as a coffee cup with a bike gear logo or a bike chain shaped into a coffee bean.
Layout and Components
Header: Sticky navigation bar with the coffee shop's logo, menu items for the shop's story, menu, community events, and contact info. Incorporate a toggle for a dark/light theme for user preference.
Hero Section: A dynamic slider showcasing the shop's interior, popular coffee dishes, and group biking events. Include catchy taglines and a "Visit Us" CTA button.
About Section: Utilize Chakra's Grid component to display a brief story of the shop, its commitment to bikers and coffee lovers, and its sustainability practices.
Menu Section: Present the coffee menu in a card layout with images and descriptions of each item. Highlight special offers for biking groups.
Events Calendar: Implement an interactive calendar for biking events and coffee workshops, allowing users to RSVP.
Footer: Include contact information, social media links, and a signup form for the newsletter, styled with Chakra's Input and Button components.
Interactive Elements
Utilize Chakra's Modal component for event details and reservations.
Implement the Accordion component for FAQs about biking meet-ups and coffee sourcing.
Custom form controls for newsletter sign-up and contact inquiries, ensuring they are accessible and mobile-responsive.
